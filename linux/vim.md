## Config
> **NOTE:**

> The `:` should not be put in a vimrc.

Run `vim --version` to see which features vim was compiled with.

The `<Leader>` key is mapped to `\` by default. It is a way of extending the VIM shortcuts by using key sequences to perform a command. Be aware that when you do press the `<leader>` key you only have 1000ms (by default) to enter the following key. A popular remapping of the `<Leader>` key is `Space`, because it is easy to reach with either hand, making the follow up key equally easy.

## NeoVIM
Note that neovim requires `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` in order to source a `.vimrc` or `.nvimrc` file:
```vim
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

source ~/.vimrc

" Neovim specific stuff:

### EasyMotion
Once easymotion is active, initiate motions using the following commands. After you initiate the motion, text decorators/markers will be displayed and you can press the keys displayed to jump to that position. `leader` is configurable and is `\` by default, although commonly remapped to `<space>`.

| Motion Command                      | Description                                                                                                    |

`<leader><leader> (2s|2f|2F|2t|2T) <char><char>` and `<leader><leader><leader> bd2t <char>char>` are also available.
The difference is character count required for search.
For example, `<leader><leader> 2s <char><char>` requires two characters, and search by two characters.
This mapping is not a standard mapping, so it is recommended to use your custom mapping.

## Common problems
### Clipboard access
* Cannot copy to clipboard / copy with middle mouse button:  
  Visual Mode requires using Shift+Mouse to select text, and CTRL+Shift+C to copy the selection.
* Linux has essentially two clipboards:
  - System clipboard (CTRL+C/V) mapped to register `+` in Vim
  - Selection clipboard (Middle Click) mapped to register `*` in Vim  
  
  You can copy explicitly to these clipboards by combining the register key `"` with a clipboard and copy command, e.g. `"+y` or `"*yy`. See also below.
* To copy to a specific clipboard with `"+y` or `"*y`:
  - Vim needs to be compiled with `+xterm_clipboard`: you can check this with `vim --version`. If it does not have it compiled in, the easiest way to get it is to install gvim:
    ```
    sudo pacman -Syu gvim
    ```
    This is a vim package with advanced features, as well as a graphical vim version (the old vim will be removed, then reinstalled).
  - Neovim requires the `wl-clipboard` package:
    ```
    sudo pacman -Syu wl-clipboard
    ```
