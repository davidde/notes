# Unity
## Installation
1. Install Unity Hub and open it.
2. Create your Unity ID and activate your license (personal = free).
3. Download and install Unity Editor (Engine):
   - Click `Installs` and click `ADD`.
   - It often hangs forever; a solution is to manually download the editor from the **Download archive** in the `ADD` popup.
   - Click `LOCATE`, and locate the manually installed `Unity.exe` in `C:\Program Files\Unity 2021.3.4f1\Editor`.
