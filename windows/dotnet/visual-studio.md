# Visual Studio (2022 onwards)
## Tips
- At any time after the Visual Studio installation, you can install workloads or components that you didn't install initially. If you have Visual Studio open, go to `Tools > Get Tools and Features...` which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Or, open Visual Studio Installer from the Start menu. From there, you can choose the workloads or components that you wish to install. Then, choose `Modify`.
