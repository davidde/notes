# Useful BASH/Zshell commands

### $ `(sudo) adduser david`   
Create a new user named 'david'; you will be prompted to set and confirm the new user password:
```
Adding user `david' ...
Adding new group `david' (1000) ...
Adding new user `david' (1000) with group `david' ...
Creating home directory `/home/david' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
```
Then it will prompt you to set the new user’s information. If you want to leave all of this information blank just press ENTER to accept the defaults:
```
Changing the user information for david
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
  Full Name []:
  Room Number []:
  Work Phone []:
  Home Phone []:
  Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y
```
If you want to add an existing user to an existing group, use:   
`sudo adduser [USER] [GROUP]`   
For example, to grant the previously created user sudo privileges:   
`sudo adduser david sudo`   
To revoke the sudo privileges:   
`sudo deluser david sudo`   

**Note:**   
Debian/Ubuntu's `adduser` was written with the purpose of being a convenient frontend to a range of utilities
(it makes use of, at one step or another, `useradd`, `usermod`, `gpasswd`, `passwd`, `chfn`, and a couple more commands).   
`adduser` and co are somewhat distro-specific in nature, being frontend scripts.   
Debian recommends that system administrators use `adduser`, `addgroup`, `deluser`, etc. over the more specific utilities.

### Android emulator:
* `~/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator -list-avds`  
List the available emulators created with [Android Virtual Device Manager](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux#set-up-the-android-emulator).

* `~/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator -avd @name-of-your-emulator`  
Run one of the listed emulators.

* `/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh`  
Launch the full Android Studio IDE.

### $ `apt-cache search [searchterm]`   
See which packages are available with 'searchterm'.

### $ `cat package.json`  
Show the content of the 'package.json' file.

* `cat >package.json`  
Create package.json from command line. This command will await input from user;  
after typing/copying text, press **CTRL+D** to exit.

* `cat file1.txt file2.txt`  
Concatenate file2.txt to file1.txt and print output.

* `cat *.VOB > moviename.vob; ffmpeg -i moviename.vob -acodec libfaac -ac 2 -ab 128k -vcodec libx264 -vpre fast -crf 20 -threads 0 moviename.mp4`  
Concatenate .vob dvd files, and then convert them to .mp4.

* `cat <(head -n 100 'Version1.srt') <(tail -n +101 'Version2.srt') > Version3.srt`  
Concatenate lines 101-end of Version2.srt to lines 1-100 of Version1.srt and store the result in Version3.srt.  
This example uses process substitution (`<` and parentheses `()` around subcommands) to feed
the stdout of the subcommands [head](#-head-pathtofile) and [tail](#-tail-pathtofile) to the stdin of `cat`.
It then redirects the stdout of `cat` to the file Version3.srt.  
See ahead for the specifics:

### `Pipe |` vs `Redirect >` vs `Process substitution <()`  
- A **redirect** is used to pass output to either a **file or stream**.  
E.g. `program > file.txt`  
If `file.txt` exists, it will be overwritten.   
If you want to append to `file.txt`, use:  
`program >> file.txt`   
If you want to pass the output from program1 to program2, you could do so with the following redirects:  
`program1 > temp_file.txt && program2 < temp_file.txt`  
But since this is so verbose, pipes were invented as a shortcut:  
`program1 | program2`
- So a **pipe** is used to pass output to another **program or utility**.  
E.g. `program1 | program2 | program3`
- However, what if you need to **pipe the stdout of multiple commands**?  
This is where **process substitution** comes in.  
Process substitution can feed the stdout of multiple processes into the stdin of another process:  
`program <(command1) <(command2)`  
Even though they look similar with the < and >, they are functionally entirely different from redirects!  
Also, process substitution does not allow spaces between the `<` and `()`.

### $ `chmod [permissions] [filepath]`   
chmod = **ch**ange **mod**e:   
Change the file mode / permissions for the file specified by 'filepath'.   
-R, --recursive: Also change permissions of files/directories inside the specified directory **and** its subdirectories.   
Example:   
`chmod -R 750 ~/projects/app`   
However, use the -R flag with care, since the default permissions for files and directories are not the same ...   
(You can use [find](./BASH.md#-find) combined with `chmod` to set different permissions for each.)   
See [chmod.md](./chmod.md) for a general introduction to linux file permissions.

### $ `chown -R  [username]:[groupname]  [filepath]`   
chown = **ch**ange **own**ership:   
Change ownership of the file/directory specified by 'filepath' to the specified 'username' and 'groupname'.   
Simply use `chown [username]` if you don't want to change group ownership.   
Use `chown [username]:`, note the left-out group, if you want to set the groupname
to the default group for that user.   
If you want to change only the group, you can use `chown :[groupname]`(note the left-out user).   
-R, --recursive: Also change ownership of files/directories inside the specified directory **and** its subdirectories.   
(Files/directories created in the future will not inherit the newly set 'username' or 'groupname',
but resort to the old ones specified by the system.)   
Example:   
`sudo chown -R david /www`   
This changes the ownership of /www (and its content) from the root user to david.   
If the directory is empty, the -R flag is pointless; it will not do anything for files yet to be created ...   
However, if you want newly created files/directories to inherit the group of its parent directory,
you can set the setgid bit on that parent directory:   
`chmod g+s [directory]`    

### $ `code --list-extensions > vscode-extensions.list`
Save all installed VScode extensions to `vscode-extensions.list`.  
Then you can easily install them all at once on another machine from this list:  
`cat vscode-extensions.list | xargs -L1 code --install-extension`

### $ `convert -background none -resize 64x64 g-logo.svg g-logo.ico`  
Use Imagemagick's convert utility to convert an `.svg` image to an `.ico` image.  
Drop the `-background none` if you want to modify the backgroundless `.svg` to white background `.ico`.  
Use the `-fill '#FF0000' -colorize 100` flag to color the image red, for example.

* `convert image.png image.jpg`  
  Imagemagick is also very straightforward for simpler conversions.

### $ `curl -i -X POST -d "isbn=978-1470184841&title=Metamorphosis&author=Franz Kafka&price=5.90" localhost:3000/books/create`  
curl = see url; it returns the content at the requested url  
-i: include http headers  
-X: Specify request command to use (e.g. POST, default is GET)  
-d: HTTP POST data

### $ `df -Th`  
Report file system disk space usage. Also useful for finding the mount points of all currently mounted file systems.  
You can also specify a path like so:   
`df -Th .`

### $ `diff -u [old_file] [new_file]`  
Check where the differences between 2 versions of a file are.  
(-u = unified diff format => easier to read.)

### $ `dpkg -s [packagename]`   
dpkg: Debian Package Manager   
Check the status (-s, --status) of the package named "packagename", i.e. is it installed, what does it do, etc.   
Make sure to use the official packagename, or it won't work. If not sure about the name, use:   
`apt-cache search [packagename]`   
This will list either the official name of your package or the official names of similar packages
if the packagename doesn't exist.

### $ `dwebp favicon.webp -o favicon.png`
Convert `.webp` image to `.png` image. Requires the `webp` package.

### $ `~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd`  
Execute dropbox-daemon on Linux.

### $ `exec <BINARY>`  
Replace the current process image of the specified executable with a new process image.  

* `exec zsh`  
  Replace the current shell process with a new one with updated aliases/variables.

### $ `ffmpeg -i input.mov -c copy -c:v libx265 output.mkv`  
Convert `input.mov` to `output.mkv`, using the H265 video **c**odec while stream-copying audio
and subtitles without any re-encoding.

Re-encoding lossy audio is generally not advisable for sound quality reasons,
but if this gives you an error (e.g. if the input audio codec is outdated or unsupported),
change the `-c copy` part into `-c:s copy`. That will result in only the video
and subtitles being copied, while the audio will be re-encoded with the current default codec,
`libvorbis` (Vorbis Audio). Most likely you'll hear no difference in sound quality, and it will
take less disk space. Alternatively, you can specify another audio codec with e.g. `-c:a libopus`
(Opus Audio), which can be considered the modern standard. `aac` and `mp3` are also possible.  
Note that not all media players consistently play H265 encoded videos without tweaks;
for instance for some H265 videos, VLC requires enabling the `VA-API Video decoder`
in `Hardware accelerated decoding` in `Input & Codecs Settings`.

* `ffmpeg -i input.mov -c copy -c:v libx265 -crf 30 output.mkv`  
  Compress `input.mov` with a **constant rate factor** of 30, and convert it to `output.mkv`.
  
  The range of the CRF scale is 0–51, where 0 is lossless, 28 is the default (23 for H264/`libx264`),
  and 51 is worst quality possible. A lower value leads to higher quality, and a subjectively sane
  range is 24–34 (18–28 for H264!). Consider a CRF of 24 (18 for H264) to be visually lossless or
  nearly so.

* `ffmpeg -i input.mov -i input.srt -c copy -c:v libx265 output.mkv`  
  Convert `input.mov` to `output.mkv`, while embedding a subtitle stream from `input.srt`.
  
  This works for both .srt and .ass subtitle files. Possible values for the subtitle codec
  (`-c:s [codec]`) are `copy`, `ass`/`ssa` (which are synonyms), and `srt` (named `subt` in
  VLC > Tools > Codec Information). `srt` subtitles are generally preferable because of wider
  compatibility and familiarity. But note that if the `ssa` subs use a non-default placement
  (e.g. for overlaying hardcoded subs in another language) this will not convert over.
  In this case it is better to stick to the original `ssa` subtitles.
  
  To also add a language identifier to the subtitle track, use:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i input.mov -i input.srt -c copy -c:v libx265 -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng output.mkv
  ```
  That is, add `language` metadata to the first (index 0) **s**ubtitle **s**tream. The convention
  is to use the 3-letter [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language
  codes. Similarly, you can add language metadata to the audio stream with `-metadata:s:a:0 language=eng`.

* `ffmpeg -i input.mov -c copy -t 15 output.mkv`  
  Convert the first 15 seconds of `input.mov` to `output.mkv`, stream-copying everything without any re-encoding.  
  
  The `-t` flag is really useful to test-run a specific command. It allows evaluating the quality of a
  fraction of the video (faster encode!) before committing to the time-intensive full command.
  
  | **Note:** |
  |-----------|
  | If you're having **aspect ratio problems**, <br> try adding a **video filter scale** like `-vf "scale=640:-2"`. |

* `ffmpeg -i main.wmv -i ending.avi -filter_complex concat=n=2:v=1:a=1 -c:v libx265 -crf 26 -r 30 output.mkv`  
  Concatenate multiple input videos with different codecs into a single video. It's recommended to specify a frame rate with `-r`
  if the videos have different frame rates, or ffmpeg might get confused.  
  concat explanation:  
  n: number of inputs  
  v: number of video streams in each input (0 to disable video)  
  a: number of audio streams in each input (0 to disable audio)

* `ffmpeg -i input.gif output.mp4`  
  `ffmpeg -i input.gif -b:v 0 -crf 25 output.mp4`  
  `ffmpeg -i input.gif -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 output.webm`  
  Convert an animated gif to `.mp4` or `.webm`.  
  
  Video, especially `.webm`, is much more efficient to load on webpages than animated gifs.   
  To replace an animated gif with video in html:   
  ```
  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="oneDoesNotSimply.webm" type="video/webm">
    <source src="oneDoesNotSimply.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  ```
  **Note:**  
  Browsers don't speculate about which `<source>` is optimal, so the order of `<source>`s matters.
  So if you specify an `.mp4` video first and the browser supports `.webm`, browsers will skip
  the `.webm <source>` and use the `.mp4` instead. If you prefer a `.webm <source>` be used first,
  specify it first!

* `ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=1280:720 output.mkv`  
  Resize the video to other resolution/aspect ratio.

### $ `find <PATH> [<FILTERS>] [<ACTIONS>]`   
Recursively finds all files/directories in `<PATH>` and its subdirectories, with the specified `<FILTERS>`.     
`find`’s power comes from it’s ability to filter which files or directories it selects
with **'tests'**, and directly performing **'actions'** on the results:   

* **Tests:**   
  * -type: f (file) or d (directory)   
  `find app -type f`   
  Find all files in the app directory, including files in its subdirectories.   
  * -maxdepth 1: Do not recurse into subdirectories.   
  `find -type f -maxdepth 1`   
  Find all files in the current directory, excluding files in its subdirectories.   
  * -name: Takes a glob that will be matched against the base of the filename (filepath without leading directories).   
  `find -name '*.ntl'`   
  Find all files with the extension '.ntl' in the current working directory and its subdirectories.   
  * -path: Same as -name, but applies to the whole filepath (including leading directories).   
  * -regex: takes a regex pattern.   
  * -amin 5: returns files last **a**ccessed less than 5 minutes ago.   
  * -mmin 5: returns files last **m**odified less than 5 minutes ago.   
  * -atime 5: returns files last **a**ccessed less than 5 days ago.   
  * -mtime 5: returns files last **m**odified less than 5 days ago.   
  * -user 'uname': returns files owned by user 'uname'.   
  * -group 'gname': returns files owned by group 'gname'.   

* **Actions:**   
  * -delete: Deletes the files that were found. Be careful!   
  First run without the -delete flag, so you see which files will be deleted.   
  * -exec 'command': Executes 'command' on the files that were found.   
  `find /www -type d -exec chmod 2750 {} \;`   
  `find /www -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \;`   
  These examples combine find with the chmod command to set different permissions on the files vs directories
  in the /www directory. `{}` is replaced by the file paths generated by find.
  The semicolon `;` denotes the end of the command, but needs to be escaped with `\`,
  otherwise it would be interpreted by the shell itself instead of find.
  
    `find . -type f -name \*.m3u8 -exec sed -i 's/\/home\/david\/Music/../g' {} \;`  
    This example uses find to find all `.m3u8` playlist files in the current directory, and combines it with executing the sed command.  
    `sed` will find `/home/david/Music`and replace it with `..` for all occurrences.

* `find . -type f -name '._*' -delete`  
Delete the Mac OS Finder `._FILENAME` [resource fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork) files, which are useless on other OSes.

* `find . -type f -name '.DS_Store' -delete`  
Delete the Mac OS Finder `.DS_Store` [Desktop Services Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store) files, which are useless on other OSes.

### $ `gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0`  
Run gatsby develop on local network.

### $ `gpasswd -a [USER] [GROUP]`   
Add the user 'USER' to the group 'GROUP' (~file permissions).   
To remove a user from a group, use:   
`sudo gpasswd -d [USER] [group]`   
Example:   
`sudo gpasswd -a david www-data`   
`sudo gpasswd -d david www-data`   
Or alternatively, use `adduser`:   
`sudo adduser david www-data`   
`sudo deluser david www-data`

### $ `grep -r 'StringToFind' .`  
Search for 'StringToFind' in all files in the current directory (.)  
-r, --recursive: Search recursively (i.e. also look in subdirectories)  
-R: Search recursively **and** follow all symbolic links.  
--exclude-dir: exclude the specified directories from being searched, e.g.:  
`grep -R --exclude-dir=node_modules 'StringToFind' [/path/to/search]`  
`grep -R --exclude-dir={node_modules,.cache} 'StringToFind' [/path/to/search]`

| :point_up: Grep is also useful for extracting substrings from a larger text: |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

* `grep -oP "^crypt\s+UUID=\K[^ ]*" /etc/crypttab`  
-o, --only-matching: return only the matched part  
-P, --perl-regexp: interpret as **Perl regex**  
^: Start of line anchor (i.e. only match when the following string is found at the start of a line)  
\s+: 1 or more spaces  
\K: **Perl regex** that causes the string matched so far to be dropped  
`[^ ]*`: Keep matching all characters, but stop when encountering a space.  
=> In other words, this extracts the UUID of the crypt device from `/etc/crypttab`.  

### $ `head path/to/file -n 10`  
Print the first 10 lines of the file. Opposite of [tail](#-tail-pathtofile--n-10).  
`-n [(-)num]`: Print the first `num` lines of the file.   
Head's output always starts at the start (head) of the file; the variable here is num:   
* Num by default measures from the head, i.e. start of the file.  
* Using `-` before the num lets num measure from the end of the file.   
This means the resulting output will be from the start of the file to `num` lines before the end of the file.

### $ `hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 (--baseURL http://<your-host-ip>:1313)`  
Run hugo server on local network.

### Install more recent versions of software than what Debian 9 (stretch) provides by default, e.g. for newer git:  
```
echo "deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list  
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install -t stretch-backports git
```  
=> Backports will install the latest stable version of git instead of the one included in stretch.

### $ `inxi -F`
Get full system information.

### $ `ip a`  
Find your IP address in the output:   
```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
'95.179.191.141' is the IP address of this machine.

### $ `java -jar briss-0.9.jar`  
(in directory where briss-0.9.jar is located; requires java)  
Start up briss, app to crop/resize/split pdfs.

### $ `jpegoptim image.jpg --size=1000k`
Compress a .jpg image to 1MB. Note that by default, it will **overwrite the original image**.  
To prevent overwriting the original image, pass it a destination directory for the resulting images:  
`jpegoptim image.jpg --size=1000k -d new_images`  
But note you will have to add the `-o` flag on consecutive calls, to overwrite the previously generated image,
since this command will not run if the target file already exists.

### $ `ln -vs <source> <destination>`  
Create a symlink. Without flags, `ln` creates by default a hard link.  
`-v, --verbose`: Be verbose; print name of each linked file.  
`-s, --symbolic`: Create symbolic link instead of hard link.  
`-f, --force`: Remove destination files that already exist (where the link should be created).  
`-T, --no-target-directory`: Treat destination always as a normal file, never as directory.

The man pages generally use the format: `ln <TARGET> <LINK_NAME>` (i.e. source = target, and destination = link name)  
I feel the python-based convention of source/destination is more intuitive than target/link. Whatever your preference,
what it comes down to is that the directory that should **hold** the link is the second argument, while the directory
that you're linking **to** (the target or source), is the first one:
```bash
# Symlink the .zshrc inside the dotfiles to `~/.zshrc`:
ln -vs ~/.dotfiles/home/.zshrc ~
# This is the same as:
ln -vs ~/.dotfiles/home/.zshrc ~/.zshrc

# However, for directories this is NOT the same, since the source/target
# is always created *inside* the destination:
ln -vs ~/.dotfiles/home/.config/vlc/ ~/.config/     # vlc folder created inside config
ln -vs ~/.dotfiles/home/.config/vlc/ ~/.config/vlc/ # vlc folder created inside vlc
```
These symlinks have the dotfiles directory as source, and the home directory as destination,
but they are said to be **from** home **to** dotfiles, which may be confusing.

If you want to create a directory symlink where the destination name differs from the source name,
you should use the `-T, --no-target-directory` flag:
```
ln -svfT ~/Pictures/wallpapers/best-backgrounds/ ~/.local/share/backgrounds/
```
The result of this is that `~/.local/share/backgrounds/` itself is the symlink that points to
`~/Pictures/wallpapers/best-backgrounds/`. Without the `-T` flag, `ln` would create a
`best-backgrounds` symlink directory **inside** `~/.local/share/backgrounds/`.

### $ `loginctl`  
Systemd login manager command. When executed without arguments it defaults to `loginctl list-sessions`.
* `loginctl list-sessions`: List the current sessions.
* `loginctl list-users`: List currently logged in users.
* `loginctl session-status [ID-from-list]`: Show runtime status information about one or more sessions.
* `loginctl terminate-session [ID-from-list]`: Terminate a session; kills all processes of the session.

### $ `ls -hal [/path/to/directory/or/file]`  
Show stats of the directory or file, including permissions (and which files for directories).  
-h (human-readable): Files sizes are displayed in the human-readable format of kilobytes and megabytes.  
-a (all): Display hidden files, including the directory itself, and its parent directory.  
-l (list): Display more information in a well-ordered list.  
=> On most systems, `ll` is an alias for `ls -lh` or `ls -la`, enter `type ll` to find out which.

### $ `mkvmerge 1.mp4 \+ 2.mp4 \+ 3.mp4 -o out.mkv`  
Concatenate multipe video files into one mkv file.  
This command can be installed with:  
`sudo apt install mkvtoolnix`

### $ `mmv "long_name*.txt" "short_#1.txt"`  
Bulk rename all files in the current working directory such that the `#1` is replaced by
whatever is matched by the first wildcard `*`. Similarly `#2` is replaced by the second, etc. Quotes are necessary!  
**Options**:  
-n: no-execute mode; just print out the changes without actually making them.

So you do something like:   
`mmv "index*_type*.txt" "t#2_i#1.txt"`  
To rename 'index4_type9.txt' to 't9_i4.txt'.

E.g.:  
`mmv -n 'Dexter-S01/Subs/Dexter-S01E*/English.srt' 'Dexter-S01/Dexter-S01E#1-en.srt'`  
To move all subtitles from their separate folders into the main series folder, with adjusted names.

### $ `nvm`  
Node Version Manager: bash script used to manage multiple active Node.js versions.

* `nvm install --lts`  
Install the node LTS release. For another version, just replace the `--lts` with the specific version number:  
`nvm install 11.4.0`
* `nvm alias default 10`  
Set the default node version to 10 (2018's LTS).
* `nvm ls`  
List all installed node versions.
* `nvm use 11.4.0`  
Change the currently active node version to 11.4.0.

### $ `npm`  
Node Package Manager: the npm command line tool is used to manage and publish javascript packages to
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

* `npm version [1.0.0]`  
  Set the version in `package.json` to 1.0.0, and create the corresponding
  [git commit](./git.md#-git-commit--a--m-description-of-changes)
  and **v1.0.0** [annotated tag](./git.md#-git-tag-tag-name).  
  Rather than explicitly specifying a version number like above, it's better practice to use
  either of `patch`, `minor` or `major` to upgrade the relevant part:   

  * `npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"`   
    Upgrade 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 and specify a commit message; `%s` indicates the resulting version number 1.0.1.
  * `npm version minor -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"`   
    Upgrade 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 and specify a commit message; `%s` indicates the resulting version number 1.1.0.
  * `npm version major -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"`   
    Upgrade 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 and specify a commit message; `%s` indicates the resulting version number 2.0.0.

  **NOTE:**  
  Since tags are *not* automatically pushed to the remote, it's recommended to explicitly push them:  
  `git push --tags (origin master)`  
  Or, if you only want to push a single tag:  
  `git push origin v1.0.0`  

* `npm publish`   
Publish the package to npmjs. Make sure the version was upgraded with `npm version` before publishing.

### $ `qpdf`
`qpdf` is a C++ command-line tool and library that performs content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It can also be used for splitting and merging files, creating files, or encrypting/decrypting them. The qpdf Manual is hosted online at https://qpdf.readthedocs.io.

  * `qpdf -decrypt Inputfile.pdf Outputfile.pdf`  
    Remove protection/encryption from pdf files.
  * `qpdf Inputfile.pdf Outputfile.pdf --split-pages`  
    Split the pdf into single page pdfs.
  * `qpdf Inputfile.pdf Outputfile.pdf --split-pages=n`  
    Split each group of n pages to a separate output pdf.
  * `qpdf Inputfile.pdf --pages Inputfile.pdf 5-6 -- Outputfile.pdf`  
    Extract a page range (or single page) from the inputfile to the outputfile.

### $ `passwd`   
Change the password for the current user.   
To change the password of root:   
  - Login to root with either `su -` or `sudo -i`.   
  - Change the password with `passwd`.
  - Log back out using **CTRL + D**, `exit` or `su - username`.
  - Test logging in with new password: `su -` or `sudo -i`.   

### $ `rename`   
Rename is a powerful command that fully supports Perl [regular expressions](./regex.md).  
If the full power of regexes is not required, the [mmv](#-mmv-long_nametxt-short_1txt) command
might be considerably simpler.

There are several versions of rename in circulation:  
- **Debian/Ubuntu Perl-based version** of rename by Larry Wall & Robin Barker,
named `prename` on CentOS and Fedora.
- **Mac version** of rename by Aristotle Pagaltzis; this is a newer implementation of
Debian's version by Larry Wall, which it is backwards compatible with.  
This means the Mac version understands e.g. `rename 's/.rar/.cbr/' *.rar`,
but Debian's version does not have the newer Mac -S flag.
- There is still another 'rename' in use on older Red Hat and CentOS distributions.

Examples:  
#### 1) Bulk rename all files in the current working directory from .rar to .cbr:
These Debian commands will work on Mac, but not the other way around!
* Debian:  
`rename -n 's/.rar/.cbr/' *.rar`  
-n, -nono: no-execute mode; just print out the changes without actually making them.  
-v, -verbose: Print names of files successfully renamed.  

* Mac:  
`rename -S .rar .cbr *.rar`  
-s, --subst: Perform a simple textual substitution of "from" to "to".
The "from" and "to" parameters must immediately follow the argument.  
-S, --subst-all: Same as "-s", but replaces every instance of the "from"
text by the "to" text.  
-n, --dry-run, --just-print: no-execute mode; just print out the changes without actually making them.  
-v, --verbose: Print additional information about the operations (not) executed.

* BASH:  
  ```
  $ for file in *.rar
    $ do
    $ mv "$file" "${file%.rar}.cbr"
    $ done
  ```

#### 2) Bulk rename all .txt files in current directory to have spaces before uppercase letters:
* Debian:   
`rename -n 's/([A-Z])/ $1/g' *.txt`  
`rename -n 's/(?<=\w)(?=[A-Z])/ /g' *.txt`  
The second, more complex command will *not* add a space before the first letter of the filename if it is uppercase.


#### 3) Remove the text 'useless_prefix_' from filenames/directories:  
* Debian:  
`rename -n 's/useless_prefix_//' *`  
* Mac:  
`rename -nS useless_prefix_ '' *`  

### $ `rm -rf /path/to/directory`    
Remove the directory **and** all its contents.   
-f, --force: ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt.   
-r, -R, --recursive: remove directories and their contents recursively.

### $ `scp /path/to/local/file remote_username@remote_server:/path/to/remote/destination`   
Securely copy a local file to a remote server over SSH.   
For the reverse, copying a remote file to your local machine, use the command with the paths reversed:   
`scp remote_username@remote_server:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination`   
**-r**: Recursively copy entire directories, e.g.:   
`scp -r /path/to/local/directory remote_username@remote_server:/path/to/remote/destination`

### $ `source <FILENAME>`  
= `. <FILENAME>`  
Read and execute commands from the specified file in the current shell context.  
Source is a synonym for the POSIX dot operator `.` in bash and zsh.  
Since `source` itself is non-POSIX, use the dot operator for maximum compatibility.

* `. ~/.zshrc`  
  Reload zsh settings (e.g. aliases).


### $ `ssh remote_username@remote_ipaddress (-i /path/to/privatekey)`    
SSH into the server with IP address 'remote_ipaddress' as user 'remote_username'.  
If your username is the same locally and on the server, you can leave it out:  
`ssh ipaddress`  
-i: Only required when using a private key not named '~/.ssh/id_rsa'.  
-p: Port to connect to on the remote host. Only required when it's a non-standard port number for ssh.   
-vvv: verbosity, useful for debugging.   
Enter `exit` or press **CTRL + D** to exit the remote server.   
See [SSH.md](./SSH.md) for a general introduction to SSH.

### $ `su - david`  
Switch to the user 'david' (su = **s**witch **u**ser). You can also switch to the root user
by invoking the command with no parameter. Unlike `sudo`, `su` asks you for the password of the user you switch to.   
Note `su -` here:  
`su -` invokes a login shell after switching the user, which resets most environment variables, providing a clean base.   
`su` just switches the user, providing a normal shell with an environment nearly the same as with the old user.   
This means it's generally safest to use `su -`.

### $ `sudo [command]`   
`sudo` is meant to run a single command with root privileges. 
Unlike `su` it prompts you for the password of the current user. This user must be in the sudoers file (`/etc/sudoers`),
or a group that is in the sudoers file. By default, Ubuntu "remembers" your password for 15 minutes,
so that you don't have to type your password every time.

### $ `sudo apt -f install`  
-f: 'fix broken'  
Fix broken dependencies.

### $ `sudo apt remove [package-name]`  
Remove a package from your system, but keep the configuration files, plugins and settings.
This helps in keeping the same settings when you want to reinstall the software.

### $ `sudo apt purge [package-name]`  
Remove a package completely from your system, including any personalized configuration files and settings.

### $ `sudo apt update`  
This will update your system's packages index (located in `/etc/apt/sources.list` for sytem defaults,
and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` for user-added sources). It will list all packages the index contains.  
If updates are available for a package, it will be listed behind it as `[x kB]`.  
You can then update any of these packages by simply reinstalling them, e.g.:  
`sudo apt install code`  
This will install a new version of vscode from the packages index.

### $ `sudo apt dist-upgrade`  
Upgrade your machine by installing the newest versions of all packages currently installed on
the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list.
An update must be performed first so that apt knows that new versions of packages are available.

### $ `sudo apt update && time sudo apt dist-upgrade`  
Update package lists and upgrade your machine while timing it.

### $ `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys [PUBKEY]`  
Fix the GPG error 'NO_PUBKEY', for example when adding a ppa to your system.  
When you run `sudo apt update` with this ppa error, you will get;  
`W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty Release:  
The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key  
is not available: NO_PUBKEY 93C4A3FD7BB9C367`,  
where `93C4A3FD7BB9C367` is the 'PUBKEY' you need to use in the command.

### $ `sudo cat /etc/sudoers`   
Print out the sudoers file; this file contains the rules that users must follow when using the sudo command.
You should never edit it directly, but use the `visudo` command (< vi + sudo):   
`visudo`   
Check the man pages for extra info on the sudoers file / vi(m) / visudo:   
`man sudoers`   
`man vi`   
`man visudo`

### $ `sudo fs_usage | grep [path_to_file]`  
Find out which application is touching the file.

### $ `sudo kill -9 [PID]`  
Kill process with PID.

### $ `sudo lsof -i :8000`  
Detect what process is listening to (and occupying) port 8000.


### $ `tail path/to/file -n 10`  
Print the last 10 lines of the file. Opposite of [head](#-head-pathtofile--n-10).  
`-n [(+)num]`: Print the last `num` lines of the file.   
Tail's output always ends at the end (tail) of the file; the variable here is num:   
- Num by default measures from the tail, i.e. end of the file.  
- Using `+` before the num lets num measure from the start of the file.  
So when using `+num`, output starts at line `num` to the end of the file (instead of num lines *from* the end).   

`-f, --follow`: Follow the file interactively as it grows.  
This is really useful for monitoring log files to troubleshoot:  

* `tail -f *.log`  
Follows (-f) all log files, so you can track potential issues.

More specific logs:  
* `tail -f /var/log/kern.log`   
// kernel-only, i.e. dmesg output

* `tail -f /var/log/syslog`     
// kernel + programs

### $ `tar xf file.tar.gz -C /path/to/directory`  
Unpack a gunzip compressed tar file.  
x: Extract the files.  
f: Specify a filename to unpack.  
(z: Uncompress the gzip file; usually no longer required.)  
(v: `verbose`; lists all of the files one by one in the archive.)  
-C: Specify the directory to unpack to (default is current directory).

### $ `touch file.txt`  
Create an empty file called 'file.txt'.

### $ `tree -H . > contents.html`
The `tree` command prints a tree diagram of the current directory structure to the terminal.  
`> contents.html` pipes the output to the file contents.html.  
`-H [href]`: print output in HTML form.

### $ `wc -c path/to/file.txt`
wc stands for word count, however with the `-c, --bytes` flag, it counts the bytes instead.

### $ `wget https://example.com`  
Download the url `https://example.com`.  
However, to download a complete site, with relative links so you can view it locally,  
the command is slightly more complex:
```bash
wget https://example.com \
   --recursive \
   --no-host-directories \
   --no-parent \
   --page-requisites \
   --convert-links \
   --adjust-extension \
   --user-agent=Mozilla \
   -e robots=off
```
| :warning: | If you need the full website, make sure to specify the root URL, <br/> and not an index page (like e.g. `https://example.com/index.php`).          |
|-----------|:------------|

#### Parameters explained:
* `--recursive, -r`  
Turn on recursive retrieving. The default maximum depth is 5.  
If the website has more than 5 levels of nested directories, then you can specify it with `--level=depth`.
* `--no-host-directories, -nH`  
Turn off DNS-resolving and make Wget compare hosts literally to make things run much faster.
* `--no-parent, -np`  
Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively.
* `--page-requisites, -p`  
Download all the files that are necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  
This includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
* `--convert-links, -k`  
After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to make them suitable for local viewing.
* `--adjust-extension, -E`  
If a file of type `application/xhtml+xml` or `text/html` is downloaded and the URL does not end  
with the regexp `\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?`, this option will cause the suffix `.html` to be appended to the local filename.
* `--user-agent=Mozilla, -U Mozilla`  
Identify as Mozilla to the HTTP server.
* `-e robots=off`  
Turn off the robot exclusion.

Other:  
* `--wait=2, -w 2`  
Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals, in this case 2 seconds.  
Use of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the requests less frequent.
* `--level=depth, -l depth`  
Specify recursion maximum depth level. Use inf as the value for infinite. (Note that this will make it take really long!)
* `--limit-rate=20K`  
Limit the download speed to 20KB/s.  
This is useful when, for whatever reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available bandwidth.
* `--no-directories, -nd`  
Download all files to the current directory.
* `--no-clobber, -nc`  
When running Wget with `--recursive`, re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the old.
Adding `--no-clobber` will prevent this behavior, instead causing the original version to be preserved,
and any newer copies on the server to be ignored. However, when the files have been downloaded before,
`--no-clobber` will be ignored when combined with `--convert-links`.
* `--accept png,jpg`, `-A png,jpg`  
Accept only files with the extensions png or jpg.
* `--reject png,jpg`, `-R png,jpg`  
Reject files with the extensions png or jpg.
* `--mirror, -m`  
Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on recursion and time-stamping,
sets infinite recursion depth and keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent
to `-recursive --timestamping --level inf --no-remove-listing`.
* `--timestamping, -N`  
Turn on time-stamping; with this option, for each file it intends to download,
wget will check whether a local file of the same name exists.
If it does, and the remote file is not newer, Wget will not download it.
* `--no-remove-listing`  
Don't remove the temporary .listing files generated by FTP retrievals.  Normally, these
files contain the raw directory listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can
be useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the
contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror you're running is
complete).
* `--span-hosts, -H`  
Allow wget to follow links that are on a different domain.  
In general, this is not recommended in combination with `--recursive`, since this will download
**every** single linked page, which will result in a huge increase in downloads.

### $ `xkill`  
Very useful command that allows you to terminate a hanging program by clicking its GUI window with the mouse.
