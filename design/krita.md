# Krita Digital Painting
## Brushes
* **Blender Blur Brush** for making good color transitions.
* 

## Tools
* **Freehand Brush Tool (B)** to paint with the selected **B**rush on the canvas.
* **Color Sampler Tool (P)** to change the working color by **P**icking a color from anywhere on canvas. You can also access it quickly by holding `CTRL` to pick a color, which is simpler since you don't have to switch back to the Brush Tool by tapping `B`.
* **Pan Tool** (the hand shaped tool at the bottom) to pan (move) the canvas around. To ease the workflow, you can access it with 2 shortcuts:
  - Hold `Space` + `Leftclick` and drag around.
  - Hold `Middleclick` and drag around.
