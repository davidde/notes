# Blender
## Hotkeys
* `Shift + A`: Add new mesh/curve/etc.
* `F9` to modify its properties.
* `N`: Transform properties.
* `S`: Scale the model (size will change in transform properties).
* `Alt + S`: Scale along NORMALS (loodrechte op het vlak); in other words it moves each vertex in the direction of its local normal, shrinking or fattening the mesh.
* `TAB`: Edit mode, for editing vertices in the model.
* `G`: Grab a vertex (after selecting it) to move it.
* `E`: Extrude (duplicate selected vertices to create more mesh)
* `H` and `Alt + H`: Temporarily hide and unhide an element.
